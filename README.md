# RR_Assignment8# Suits Viewership Analysis

This project contains the analysis of viewership data for the American legal drama television series "Suits." It explores how the audience size changed from the show's debut in June 2011 to its finale in September 2019.

## Overview

"Suits" debuted to critical acclaim and garnered a substantial audience. Over time, viewership trends evolved, reflecting a range of influences from changes in the showâ€™s cast to the shifting landscape of television consumption.

## Data

The analysis is based on data that includes average viewership numbers across all nine seasons, each episode's air date, and viewership growth percentages. This data is visualized through a series of plots that illustrate trends over time.

## Visualizations

Two primary visualizations are included:
1. **Average Viewership by Season**: A line graph showing the average number of viewers for each season.
2. **Viewership Over Time**: A line graph displaying viewership patterns for individual episodes over the series' duration.

## Findings

The analysis indicates a clear viewership peak in the initial seasons, followed by a gradual decline. Despite the decline, a core audience remained loyal to the show until the end.
